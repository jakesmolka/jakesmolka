## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I'm working at [Better](https://github.com/better-care/)

Previously I worked on [EHRbase](https://github.com/ehrbase), an open source Clinical Data Repository based on [openEHR](https://www.openehr.org/)

ðŸ’¬ Talk with me about Medical Informatics, (semantical) interoperablity, eHealth platforms and their architecture, well and openEHR of course
