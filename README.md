## Hi there 👋

🔭 I'm working at [Vitagroup](https://vitagroup.ag) on the [Health Intelligence Platform](https://hip.vitagroup.ag).

🎥 Check out my talk at the Spring I/O 2022: [Building a cloud-native health-care data integration with Dapr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3giF_EmJ7l8).

Previously I worked:

➡️ at [Better](https://github.com/better-care/) on FHIR Connect, see:
- https://blog.better.care/introducing-fhir-connect
- https://github.com/better-care/fhir-connect-mapping-spec

➡️ on [EHRbase](https://github.com/ehrbase), an open source Clinical Data Repository based on [openEHR](https://www.openehr.org/).

💬 Talk with me about Medical Informatics, (semantical) interoperablity, eHealth platforms and their architecture, cloud-native, well and openEHR of course.
